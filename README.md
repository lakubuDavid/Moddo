# Why ?

So I started experimenting with Go last week and decided that this would be a good fit as a test project for :
- Text manipulation in Go
- Bascic data structures in Go
- Also use a lot of different different language with interaction between them in some projects and it was the tool I needed

Anyway I will write a small doc later since it's still pretty early and I also need to add some comment (even though I believe the code is understandable...maybe)

# What doesn't work

- Modifiers are useless for now
- Only basic types
- No collections

# The goal

- [x] Generate base classes
- [ ] have modifiers work (especially the @many one that will be used for collections)
- [ ] Some new ideas...

# Wanna help ?

Don't.

At least not now but you can look at the code and get inspired from it.
